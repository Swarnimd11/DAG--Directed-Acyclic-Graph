# DAG--Directed-Acyclic-Graph

A directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a data structure consisting of nodes and edges, where the edges represent dependencies between the nodes. DAGs are widely used in various applications such as task scheduling, data processing, and machine learning. The nodes in a DAG can represent tasks, data, or computations, while the edges represent the order in which these tasks or computations should be performed. DAGs are useful for modeling complex systems where there are many dependencies between different components. The architecture for a DAG system involves storage, job scheduling, distributed computing, and monitoring and debugging. Overall, DAGs are a powerful tool for managing and optimizing complex workflows, and they continue to be an important area of research in computer science and related fields.
